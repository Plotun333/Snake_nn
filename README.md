# Snake_nn

##  About
### this program simulates a game with 2000 snakes and slowly creates a snake AI thanks to genetic algorithms and neural netowks

## Library
### this project was created thanks to my [Neural Network Library](https://github.com/atOliverParkerMorgan/Neural_network-lib) 

## Problems 
* ### to create a good snake AI you will need to simulate this progarm for about a 72 hours (depending on the speed of your computer)
## Saving
* ### program will automaticly save the best snake. To see the best snake press => Esc and select Best AI
## How does it look

## What did i learn 
* ### how to mutate and crossover NeuralNetork information (weights, biases)
* ### how to optimize a simulation
* ### how to save a object with [pickle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html)
* ### how to control a population in a genetic algorithm (breed the best and "kill" the worst)
* ### how to create an architecture of a neural network for given task
